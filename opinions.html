<a href="papers/what-professors-do.html">What Professors Do.</a>  Way back in 1995, the Massachusetts State Legislature declined to increase faculty salaries.  The Secretary of Finance and Administration, Charles Baker, said faculty were "underworked and overpaid."  My wife and I, both associate professors at the time, wrote an editorial in which we documented our work in the course of a week.  Few people understand what professors do, many think we "have summers off" and we "don't understand the real world." This is our own fault:  We need to communicate what we do, what universities have become, and how higher education actually works. Reviewing this editorial at a distance of twenty years it seems quaint:  Things soon became busier and less idealistic. 

<br><br><a href ="papers/Polymathy.pdf">A Return to Polymathy.</a> The systemic problems of our age -- climate change, food and water security, aging, energy -- are not neatly confined to academic disciplines, yet universities continue to organize themselves into narrow units that don't talk to each other.  Academic researchers generally are ill-equipped to study systemic problems that cross disciplines.  Yet it seems plausible to develop a curriculum of near-universal abstractions that, once mastered, encourage polymathy. I worry that if we don't start to train polymaths (and provide them with technologies to integrate huge numbers of narrow results, see, e.g., <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/program/big-mechanism">Big Mechanism</a>) then we won't be able to understand and manage the systems on which civilization depends. 

<br><br><a href ="papers/focal-problems.pdf">Focal Problems.</a>  I am lucky to work in Artificial Intelligence, which has always been driven by applied problems.  Some problems are better than others at accelerating fundamental research (see also <a href="papers/ifNotWhatAAAI.pdf">"If not Turing's Test, then What?"</a> and <a href="papers/AAAI04InvitedTalk.pdf">accompanying</a> AAAI 2004 invited talk). Good "focal" problems seem to satisfy half a dozen criteria, which I describe and illustrate in this short note. 

<br><br>Evaluation and Methods.  As an undergraduate in psychology I learned about experimental methods and research statistics. By the early 1990s, I had the sense that AI researchers rarely made and tested empirical claims, but I had no data to back this up.  So I surveyed all the papers in our major, annual conference, and <a href="papers/882-879-1-PB.pdf">here</a> are the results. Later on, I wrote a book called <a  href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/empirical-methods-artificial-intelligence"><i>Empirical Methods for Artificial Intelligence</i></a>. I also teach a course on research methods for computer scientists and I give <a href="papers/empiricalMethodsTutorial.pdf">tutorials</a>.
