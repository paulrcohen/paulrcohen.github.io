<h2>What Professors Do</h2>

In the acrimony surrounding Governor Weld's refusal to back a salary increase
for UMass faculty, we have heard too many vague, ill-informed statements about
how professors spend their time.  Our purpose here is to describe a week in the
life of couple of professors, so the taxpayers of Massachusetts can draw their
own conclusions about whether we are underworked and overpaid, as alleged by
Secretary Baker.  We are associate professors in Computer Science and
Psychology, respectively, at the Amherst campus of the University of
Massachusetts.  We are typical of faculty in strong research departments.   Last
week was intersession, when faculty don't teach.  Otherwise it was a typical
week.  We worked from 9am to 11pm every day last week with 2-hour breaks for
exercise and dinner, and we regularly work on the weekends.  If the following
account seems a bit scattered, that's an accurate picture: most faculty divide
their time between teaching, research, committee work, advising students, and
writing papers and proposals.   Our days are long, but we are not complaining;
our jobs are intellectually rewarding and many people work longer hours for
fewer rewards.
<p>
Last week's research efforts were especially rewarding for Carole, who finished
a study of 32 children in Springfield, MA.  It took all day, Wednesday, to get
the last four children interviewed (paying the $5 stipend for each participant
in the project out of her own pocket, as well as their parking costs) and much
of Thursday and Friday to analyze the data.  Paul spent roughly ten hours
working with graduate students on several projects, and four hours of
preparation.  Carole learned that four pieces of work had been accepted for
presentation at a conference this summer, and spent some time informing her
coauthors and preparing revisions. (Carole spends roughly $1500/year of her own
money attending conferences.)  Paul finished editing a paper for a symposium
this March, helped two graduate students edit their papers for the same
symposium, and revised some figures for a forthcoming book.  Each of us spent
approximately four hours writing letters of recommendation for undergraduates
and graduate students, and another two hours advising these students on how to
write applications for graduate school, fellowships, postdoctoral and faculty
positions. So far this winter Carole has sent out about 200 letters of
recommendation for students, all prepared on her own office computer, with
supplies (paper and printer toner) purchased out of her own pocket because the
University does not provide office supplies beyond a few legal pads a semester.
Paul read the dissertation of a researcher who might join his lab, spent two
hours discussing research with a faculty colleague, and three hours on the phone
with collaborators in Colorado and New Jersey.
<p>
Funding is a continuing headache.  The national funding picture is changing so
rapidly that it's a full-time job to keep current.  We spent an hour meeting
with Paul's lab manager, who is coordinating a series of proposals to NSF, NASA,
NIH and private foundations pertaining to science education for women and
minorities.  Paul spent two additional hours in funding meetings, two hours on
the phone with funding agents and colleagues, and an hour in email.  This was a
slow week; the next major proposal isn't due until Feb.  15.  We have submitted
or coordinated three proposals, two preproposals, and two fellowship proposals
since mid-December, but funding is so tight that Paul will be lucky to see one
proposal in four funded.  Funding is even more limited in Carole's field
(perhaps 5% of psychology proposals submitted to federal sources are funded), so
she does not realistically expect any of the six proposals she has submitted so
far this year to be funded.  Paul must maintain funding for four staff and five
graduate students, a medium-size lab for Computer Science.  
<p>
Most faculty serve the university and national communities.  Carole sits on the
personnel committee, Paul is the graduate program director.  We each sit on
international editorial boards and conference committees.  Last week, Carole
spent 2 hours and Paul 6 hours on these responsibilities; note that when the
term is in session, these times increase significantly as the result of regular
committee meetings and increased task assignments.  Next week, Paul will start
working through a stack of journal articles to review.  Carole reviews 1-2
manuscripts a week on a regular basis for journals in her field; each review
requires 1-2 hours.  
<p>
Email claimed roughly 30 minutes each day last week; despite this, it's an
efficient way to answer questions from students, coordinate projects across the
country, set up meetings, and so on.  Carole has been involved since July in
efforts to obtain birth record information from the state Office of Vital
Statistics in Boston; this information is required by the faculty and graduate
students in her research area to recruit infant and child participants in
research, including masters and doctoral projects.  Although the application for
this information was approved the information still has not been provided;
Carole spends an hour a week on the phone and writing letters on this topic.  In
addition, she and several colleagues have spent approximately 2 hours a week for
the last 4 months trying to arrange for our research office in Springfield MA to
be moved to a new location.  This involved driving to Springfield to look at new
offices, as well as completing forms required by the University and the State.
Although the space we have found is significantly cheaper and safer than the
current location -- which is downright dangerous -- we learned yesterday that
the paperwork will take a year to be approved by the University Planning office
and DCPO in Boston.  Thus, this task will continue to occupy several hours a
week for the next year, time that is not recognized in any formal way yet is
essential for the maintenance of our graduate and undergraduate courses.  
<p>
Next week Paul will spend approximately eight hours on TA assignments, getting
ready for the new term.  Speaking of which, we both spent approximately four
hours last week selecting readings for our respective seminars.  When term
begins, Carole will teach two courses; Paul, one.  His funding supports a
colleague to teach his remaining course.  We will spend approximately three
hours per course per week in the classroom and roughly six hours per course
meeting in preparation.  In addition, Carole spends one evening a week (3 hours)
attending a graduate student - faculty research seminar; this seminar meets
every week, term in and out; attendance is essential, and Carole makes regular
presentations at these seminars as well as help students prepare for their
presentations, which provide essential training for conference presentations,
job interviews and other professional presentations.  Carole also spends 5-6
hours per week meeting with students in her courses, particularly in one of her
spring courses in which students conduct projects in the community and need very
careful direct supervision.  She lost an hour this week to a student who didn't
show up for a scheduled appointment, and another explaining to irate students who
have been closed out of her oversubscribed spring courses that the courses are
full, and advising them about possible alternatives (which are few in number,
because our department has lost several faculty who have not been replaced).
Several of these students may face difficulties in completing graduation
requirements by May because they cannot get into courses required for their
major.
<p>
Not all faculty spend their time as we do.  Some spend more time teaching, some
devote more time to funding, many have much heavier committee responsibilities.
We are happy in our jobs, and we are fortunate to have them, but we hope it's
clear that we are not underworked or overpaid.  We and our colleagues are weary.
We have little time to read journals or new books, or keep up with Internet
traffic (although Carole spends roughly $500/year on books, out of pocket,
because the University library has been devastated by cuts.) We don't really
have the time to write this letter.  Perhaps this is why people are so
ill-informed about what professors do: we don't have time to explain ourselves
to the community.  We take on more work every year, as our labs branch out into
new areas, and we teach more students.  We spend more of our own money on
research every year.  We aren't funded by the University during the summer,
although we aren't on vacation;  most of the activities described above continue
unabated.  It's absurd that a couple of professors feel the need to explain
themselves to the community.  Surely, the University should take at least this
responsibility, instead of issuing "report cards" that the public and the
legislature interpret as admissions of failure.
