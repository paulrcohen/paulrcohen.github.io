<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<i>The paper describes two separate but synergistic tools for running experiments
  on large Lisp programs. The first tool, called / (Common Lisp
  Instrumentation Package), allows the researcher to define and run experiments,
  including experimental conditions (parameter values of the planner or
  simulator) and data to be collected.  The data are written out to data files
  that can be analyzed by statistics software.  The second tool, called /
  (Common Lisp Analytical Statistics Package), allows the researcher to analyze
  data from experiments by using graphics, statistical tests, and various kinds
  of data manipulation.  / has a graphical user interface (using /,
  the Common Lisp Interface Manager) and also allows data to be directly
  processed by Lisp functions.  Finally, the paper describes a number of other
  data-analysis modules have been added to work with / and /.
