The paper describes two separate but synergistic tools for running
experiments on large Lisp systems such as planning systems, by which
we mean systems that produce plans and execute them in some kind of
simulator.  The first tool, called <a href="../research/clip-clasp-details.html#clip">CLIP</a> (Common Lisp
Instrumentation Package), allows the researcher to define and run
experiments, including experimental conditions (values for parameters
of the planner or simulator) and data to be collected.  The data are
written out to data files that can be analyzed by statistics software.
The second tool, called <a href="../research/clip-clasp-details.html#clasp">CLASP</a> (Common Lisp
Analytical Statistics Package), allows the researcher to analyze data
from experiments by using graphics, statistical tests, and various
kinds of data manipulation.  CLASP has a graphical user interface
(using CLIM, the Common Lisp Interface Manager) and also allows data
to be directly processed by Lisp functions.
